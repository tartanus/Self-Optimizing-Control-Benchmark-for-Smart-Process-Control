# Self-Optimizing-Control-Benchmark-for-Smart-Process-Control
GCNM SOC control benchmark for First Order plus Dead Time processes.

To execute the benchmark download the files and extract into a folder. Then open matlab and run the File benchmarkPIDStart.m in the same directory. You can modify the Simulink files to attach your own SOC controller.

This benchmark requires Matlab 2019b and is compatible with later releases.
